# #2 Python and Node.js TUIs for a LangGraph agent with memory

## üìñ Description üìñ

Add memory to the [#1 TUI for a LangGraph agent with a web connection](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/tree/main/langchain-tutorials/1-TUI_LangGraph_agent_Tavily) tutorial.

> [!NOTE]
> In this tutorial, we'll implement in-memory storage for a LangGraph agent using the `MemorySaver` class. The data is stored temporarily in the computer's RAM, enabling quick access and retrieval during the agent's operation. However, this memory will be lost when the script exits or the app is terminated, as it isn't stored persistently.

> If you're looking for a persistent memory implementation for a LangGraph agent, please see the [#3 TUI for a LangGraph agent with persistent memory using PostgreSQL](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/tree/main/langchain-tutorials/3-TUI_LangGraph_agent_PostgreSQL_memory) tutorial.

## üß† Learning goals üß†

- **Understanding LangGraph [checkpointers](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/tree/main/libs/checkpoint):** Checkpointers provide a persistence layer for LangGraph. They allow you to interact with and manage the graph's state. When you use a graph with a checkpointer, the checkpointer saves a checkpoint of the graph state at every superstep, enabling several powerful capabilities like human-in-the-loop, "memory" between interactions, and more.

- **Implementing in-memory storage using the [`MemorySaver`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/checkpoint.MemorySaver.html) class:** We'll show how to enhance a LangGraph ReAct agent by adding in-memory storage capabilities using the `MemorySaver` class. The `MemorySaver` class provides a practical implementation of checkpointers with a LangGraph agent. This feature allows your agent to memorize the conversation. In-memory storage means the data is temporarily stored in the computer's RAM, allowing for quick access and retrieval during the agent's operation. However, this memory will be lost when the script exits or the app is terminated, as it isn't stored persistently.

## üöÄ Getting started üöÄ

Before running [`tui_langgraph_agent_memory.py`](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/blob/main/langchain-tutorials/2-TUI_LangGraph_agent_memory/python/tui_langgraph_agent_memory.py) or [`tui_langgraph_agent_memory.js`](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/blob/main/langchain-tutorials/2-TUI_LangGraph_agent_memory/nodejs/tui_langgraph_agent_memory.js), follow the instructions below.

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions are specific to Windows. For macOS or Linux, please use the corresponding commands for your operating system.

### Python

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground.git`
2. Change the directory: `cd ai-playground/langchain-tutorials/2-TUI_LangGraph_agent_memory/python`
3. Create a virtual environment named `my-venv`: `python -m venv my-venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment `my-venv`: `my-venv/scripts/activate`
5. Install the dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Create an `.env` file to set up your environment variables
7. Run the Python script: `python tui_langgraph_agent_memory.py`

> [!WARNING]
> Deactivate the virtual environment `my-venv` after you're finished by running the following command:
>
> ```
> deactivate
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your `.env` file should contain the following environment variables:
>
> ```bash
> OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
> TAVILY_API_KEY = "tvly-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
> ```

> [!TIP]
> You can verify that the virtual environment is _created_ successfully if you see a folder named `my-venv` inside the `python` directory.
>
> ```

>         .gitignore
>         requirements.txt
>         tui_langgraph_agent_memory.py
> ```
>
> You can verify that the virtual environment is _activated_ successfully if you see `(my-venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, like this:
>
> ```
> (my-venv) C:\your\path\to\ai-playground\langchain-tutorials\2-TUI_LangGraph_agent_memory\python
> ```
>
> You can verify that the virtual environment is _deactivated_ successfully if you don't see `(my-venv)` anymore at the beginning of your terminal prompt, like this:
>
> ```
> C:\your\path\to\ai-playground\langchain-tutorials\2-TUI_LangGraph_agent_memory\python
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> `venv` is a built-in Python module that allows you to create and manage virtual environments. If you have Python `3.3` or higher installed, you can start using `venv` right away.

### Node.js

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground.git`
2. Change the directory: `cd ai-playground/langchain-tutorials/2-TUI_LangGraph_agent_memory/nodejs`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm i`
4. Create an `.env` file to set up your environment variables
5. Run the Node.js script: `node tui_langgraph_agent_memory.js`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your `.env` file should contain the following environment variables:
>
> ```bash
> OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
> TAVILY_API_KEY = "tvly-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
> ```

## üî• Working example in Python üî•

If you run [`tui_langgraph_agent_memory.py`](https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground/blob/main/langchain-tutorials/2-TUI_LangGraph_agent_memory/python/tui_langgraph_agent_memory.py), you should be able to chat with the agent in a terminal:

> User:<br>
> Hi, I'm Bob!
> <br><br>
> Agent:<br>
> Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?
> <br><br>
> User:<br>
> Tell me what's my name.
> <br><br>
> Agent:<br>
> Your name is Bob!
> <br><br>
> User:<br>
> Quit
> <br><br>
> Agent:<br>
> Have a nice day! üëã

> [!NOTE]
> If the memory wouldn't be implemented, the chat would look as follows:
> <br>
> > User:<br>
> Hi, I'm Bob!
> <br><br>
> Agent:<br>
> Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?
> <br><br>
> User:<br>
> Tell me what's my name.
> <br><br>
> Agent:<br>
> I'm unable to know your name as I don't have that information. If there's anything specific you'd like me to help you with, feel free to ask!
